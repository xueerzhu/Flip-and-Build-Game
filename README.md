# Infinity
- I used the infinite extent of my world to represent an infinite grid of tiles. 
All of them can be clicked and flipped to turn into road blocks. And they serve as the foundational game objects. 

# Variation in Space
- As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see that they are the creator of what this world could look like. 
All tiles are facing backwards from the player. As player interacts with the colorful tiles, they turn into black road blocks if their color matches.

# Variations in Key
- Different worlds will have different starting two nodes for the game - the goals will be different. 
- Different worlds will also have completely different colored tiles. 
- These variations ensure that this game is procedurally generated and could be  replayed. 

# Signs of Life
- Clicking tiles causes the tiles to "flip". And they turn into black road blocks if the two color matches. 
- If road blocks continuously connect the two special tiles with white dots. Player wins the game!
